      Gotham's time has come.

  This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.

  It's ends here.

  Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

  Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.

  Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?

  Now choice is yours: exile or death?

  All creatures feel fear. Especially the scary ones.

  Perhaps you should read the instructions first?

  I just want my phone call.

  Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness.

  You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?". He comes at me with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face." and... Why so serious?

  When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

  Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.
